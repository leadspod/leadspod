		<h2>Email Relay Server?</h2>

		<p>Our relay server is at the heart of our infrastructure and allows you to precisely schedule and manage multiple email accounts. It also
			schedules and creates the emails for our email warmup service.</p>
		<p>When you order an Email Relay Server, it will take a few hours to set up. You will get an email with all the detail on how to connect it to
			the Mautic software. Then, you will be able to use all the email addresses you added to the warmup service.</p>

		<h2>Email Automation</h2>

		<p>We are using “Cutting edge marketing automation empowered by Mautic.” To use Mautic for cold email, we have created an infrastructure that
			allows you to precisely schedule and manage multiple email accounts.</p>
		<p>After you have received the details of the Relay Server and connected it to your Mautic server, you will be able to use all the email
			addresses you added to the warmup service.</p>
		<p>To get started with Mautic, we suggest doing a quick tutorial with one of the many tutorials on Youtube. Very soon we will be launching our
			course.</p>
