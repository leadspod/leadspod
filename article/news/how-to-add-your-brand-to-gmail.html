        <p>The Complete Guide to Displaying Your Profile Photo in Gmail</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Gmail is that when you send an email from your Gmail address (e.g. name@gmail.com), your Google account profile picture will appear next to your email address. However, you won’t see the Google Account profile picture when sending email using Gmail from a non-Gmail domain.</p>

<p>I’m specifically talking about different email addresses set under “Send email as” in the “Accounts” and “Gmail import” settings.</p>

<p>For example like name@yourcompany.com.</p>

<p>yourname@gmail.com &lt;- Profile picture is displayed. 
name@yourcompany.com &lt;- Profile picture is not displayed.</p>

<p>Talk about boring!</p>

<p>Where is the character?
If you get your branding right, you’ll want to be consistent across all social media channels, including Gmail. Sure, you might have a great custom signature line, but it shouldn’t end there.
Do you really want a blue people logo that represents your company in the email?
the new. That are great news. There is a very simple solution to showing your Google Account profile photo when sending email from a non-Gmail domain!</p>

<p>“What’s my profile picture in my Google Account?” You asked?
This:</p>

<p>Profile picture of Gmail</p>

<p>In addition, you can completely modify this photo if you wish.
Here’s how to view your Google Account profile picture when sending email from a non-Gmail domain. Follow these steps to view your Google Gmail account profile picture when sending email from a non-Gmail domain. Example: Your domain is yourcompany.com and you can use Gmail to send email to name@yourcompany.com.
This is a quick and easy five-click process. It shouldn’t take more than three minutes. (Four or five cases for alcohol consumption or lack of sleep. Six minutes for both)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>On your desktop / laptop, go to https://myaccount.google.com (or in Gmail, click your profile picture in the top right corner of the page, then click My Account).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the left side of the page, click Personal Information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under CONTACT INFO, click on the arrow to the right of the email. Scroll down to a different email address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add your new / alternate / company to the alternate email cell. Note: If you can’t see the Alternate Email tab, you may need to click the Advanced button. There should be a “Legacy Email” section.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here you need to add all the email to your domain that you want to send from and view your Google account profile. Such as name@yourcompany.com.
You have to confirm the new email address by sending a confirmation email to the email address you added as an alternate email address.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check the new “Alternative” email when it hits your inbox. Do not skip this step as your profile picture will not appear until you do this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To test, send an email to anyone with a Gmail email address. You should see your profile photo next to your name.
Like him:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Ask the recipient to send you a screenshot of what they see to make sure it works.</p>
