        <p>Deliverability is critical when sending cold emails.</p>

<p>Estimates are that over 20% of emails never reach the inbox.</p>

<p>We frequently see new email accounts used for cold email campaigns terminated mid-campaign. With Google’s spam change in January 2019, it’s getting harder to get into the inbox. You must first warm up your new email account to avoid this before sending out a cold email.</p>

<p>This article will explain how to warm up an email account before sending cold emails to avoid the SPAM folder.</p>

<p>The warmup procedure involves sending emails from a new email account, starting small and increasing daily. When a user opens a new email account, the provider limits daily email sending. New accounts will be unable to use it fully. For example, Google Workspace subscribers get 2000 emails per day. But you are restricted until you have established a good reputation.</p>

<p>Optimal deliverability should take 8-12 weeks.</p>

<p>Preparation time depends on email volume and participation during the warming process.</p>

<p>A cold email must first reach the recipient’s inbox. Positive engagement will help you build a relationship. Before sending a cold email, warming up the account helps avoid the spam filter, get into the inbox, and get opened more often.</p>

<p>Preparing an Email Account for a Cold Email!</p>

<p>Customize Emails Sending emails to friends and colleagues to start conversations is the first step. Send ten to twenty emails from your new email account to begin. Assuring constant engagement with the initial emails will help increase email volume. Over time, growing confidence in your authenticity prepares your email account for email campaigns. When using the manual method, personalize the subject line to improve response.</p>

<p>During this manual process, send emails to Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, iCloud, Godaddy, Zoho, Aol, Exchange, and Yandex. Sending to all major email providers will help you get past spam filters. </p>

<p>Maintain email Threads in your warmup emails to increase deliverability. So start by sending emails from your old accounts and responding from your new ones. Regular interactions are critical here, as this is an 8-12 week process.</p>

<p>Join Newsletters from publications in your industry. Subscribe to a minimum of 10-15 newsletters. Return to your mailbox to confirm each newsletter subscription. It will verify your account and expand your email inbox. Receiving emails is as important as sending emails to warm up a new email account.</p>

<p>Keep a time difference between two emails Each email service provider has its algorithm for confirming delivery. So show those algorithms you’re not a robot by not sending too many emails at once. Sending many emails in a short period can harm your domain’s reputation. To avoid this, keep a significant time difference between two emails while warming up your new account.</p>

<p>Sending too many emails in a single session triggers spam filters, and email providers will block account temporarily or permanently.</p>

<p>Begin small and simple. Begin with a small list of 20-30 reliable receivers, augmented by friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>Personalize email to persuade your recipients to open and respond.  Create a unique subject line to maximize open rates.  Personalization is key to provoking responses.</p>

<p>Avoid spam words like FREE, GRAB, and 50% in your emails. These will trigger SPAM filters.</p>

<p>Keep the information simple and plain, with few links and media files (photos, movies, GIFs) for best delivery.</p>

<p>Always include an unsubscribe link. One spam report against a newly created account can damage your reputation. Having an unsubscribe link in your emails gives your recipients a choice not to receive further emails.</p>

<p>The system exists to filter spam. Following best practices shows algorithms that you are not a spammer. And perhaps most importantly, remember that improving your reputation as a sender is easier than improving a spammer’s reputation.</p>

<p>Write as a genuine human being would.</p>

<p>Lastly, don’t forget to verify your accounts with these three critical components technically:</p>

<p>SPF creates a record in your DNS (Domain Name System) that identifies all servers allowed to send emails on behalf of a domain. Because SPF Authentication is on the sender’s side, the recipient Email Service Provider gives the sender’s domain a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>DKIM prevents email spoofing with a digital signature and ensures that your message reaches the intended recipient.</p>

<p>DMARC records use SPF and DKIM records to reassure the recipient’s email service provider (ESP) that the email is not the result of a misleading activity.</p>
