        <p>The story of Maddie Bregman.</p>

<p>Cold emails aren’t just for sales or business. You can use them for getting advice, building relationships, or finding a job, so if you don’t want to be an entrepreneur, you can use cold emails to reach out to people in the field you’re interested in.</p>

<p>Maddie Bregman started a company, and her first client, was the NFL, and she got them to sign through cold emailing the Vice President. She used to go through executive CEO CMO’S and CEO’S but learned that these people are receiving hundreds of cold emails a day. Instead, she emailed a vice president, had an initial conversation with someone on their team, and closed them as clients a few weeks later.</p>

<p>She also used cold email to get responses from Mark Cuban, Sheryl Sandberg, and Arianna Huffington.</p>

<p>She says people are more likely to respond if we can add value upfront when sending cold emails. Don’t ask busy people to grab a coffee so you can pick their brain, and then ask if you’ll commit to being your lifelong mentor. Those cold emails get ignored.</p>

<p>She tries to live by this idea of the third door. It’s the idea that life, business, and success are like a nightclub. There are three ways in the first door is the main entrance where the line curves around the block and where 99% of people wait hoping to get in the second door is the VIP entrance where billionaires and celebrities slip through the third door is the entrance where you have to jump out a line running down the alley and sneak through the kitchen there’s always a way.</p>

<p>To prepare for a TedX talk, she asked people who have given great talks, so she emailed Mark Cuban, Ben Horowitz, and Beth Comstock and asked them a straightforward question how do you give a really good talk and they all got back to her. Mark Cuban, one of the sharks on Shark Tank, said to relax and tell her personal story. Ben Horowitz is one of the founders of Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that has invested in companies like Facebook and Pinterest. He said the three keys to an excellent presentation are a compelling opening, a strong ending, and keeping the two as close together as possible Beth Comstock, the vice-chair of General Electric, said to get out of my head and be present.</p>

<p>Get out of our comfort zone when we use the third door, and when we’re not afraid to try, we grow even if we don’t know where to start.</p>
